# Days-between-two-dates
A program to calculate ages in days using the datetime module in Python

I built a program that:

ðŸ”¹ Takes a date of birth as input

ðŸ”¹Validates the date format (DD-MM-YYYY)

ðŸ”¹Handles errors gracefully using exception handling.

ðŸ”¹Calculates the exact number of days between today and the entered date.

ðŸ”¹Detects and alerts if a future date is entered


This was a great way to explore:

ðŸ”¹ datetime module

ðŸ”¹try-except blocks

ðŸ”¹Type-safe and user-friendly input handling
